### 90s
I’d like to talk about a recent achievement that made me feel really proud.
A few months ago, I decided to train for a marathon because my friends encouraged me.
I had never been good at running, so I wasn’t sure if I could finish.
To prepare, I made a training schedule.
I ran 5 km every weekday and 10 km on weekends.
I also watched YouTube videos to improve my running form.
After three months of this routine, I finished the marathon.
I still remember the great feeling I had when I crossed the finish line.
From this experience, I learned that if I keep putting in the effort, I can reach my goals.

### 180s
I’d like to talk about a recent achievement that made me feel truly proud.
A few months ago, I decided to run a full marathon because my friends encouraged me.
Before this, I was never a sporty person, and running even a short distance felt difficult.
I wondered if I could ever complete such a long race.
However, I decided to take it seriously and made a clear training schedule.
On weekdays, I ran 5 kilometers each day, and on weekends, I pushed myself to 10 kilometers.
I also watched YouTube videos to improve my running form, which helped me run more efficiently and avoid injuries.
During my training, I worked hard to improve my diet and lifestyle.
As a result, I lost about 5 kilograms before the actual race.
Losing that extra weight gave me more energy and made running feel less tiring.
Finally, after three months of preparation, I ran the marathon and crossed the finish line without stopping.
I will never forget the amazing feeling of pride and joy at that moment.
From this experience, I learned the value of proper preparation and realized that with consistent effort, I can achieve even the toughest goals.
